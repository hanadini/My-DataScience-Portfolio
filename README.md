# My-DataScience-Portfolio
DSc. Studies and minor/major Projects 
This repository includes portfolio of data science projects completed by me for researching, self-taught. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.


_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents
- ### Exploratory data analysis (EDA):data cleaning and visualisation in Python
(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/EDA)

	- [Clickthrough rate (CTR)]: I analyze the ratio of the number of users exposed to a link on a website.
	
	- [NLP-EDA]: I did data analysis, feature engineering for NLP, cleaning and text processing.
        
	- [Lego]: In this project, I will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!
	
	- [House price]: I did my best to follow a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, analysis of the data.

- ### Machine Learning in Python 

(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20in%20Python)

	- [CLV(Customer Lifetime Value) & Churn prediction]: In this project it was working For an online retail, can select North Star Metric as Monthly Revenue.
	
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 

- ### Deep Learning Projects: 

(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/DL(Rnn%2CCnn%2CMlp%2CTF))

	- [Recommendation System]: I used datasets hosted by Kaggle and considering the content-based approach, for building job recommendation systems.

	- [Computer Vision]: Evaluate Pixel Scaling Methods for Image Classification With CNNs,with MNIST Handwritten Image Classification Dataset. Using Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification,training the model and image augmentation via the ImageDataGenerator class.
	
	- [Natural Languagee processing]:NLP (Simple-RNN, LSTM, BD-LSTM,GRU)and Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project.
	
	- [BERT for classification]: the dataset from Kaggle is text from consumer finance complaint narrative, the model attempts to predict which product the complaint is about. So is a multi-class classification problem.

	- [TensorFlow(tf.keras)] Develope MLP, CNN,RNN models with tensorflow.Visualize, plot, save and load models and getting better performance from the model in tf.
	
	- [Speech_To_Text] A speech recognition system is built that understands simple spoken commands. Tensorflow dataset includes 65000 one-sec of 30 short words uttered by thousands of diffrent people.
	
- ### Micro Projects: 
	- __R__ 
(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio)

	- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems]: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
		
	- [ML Decision Trees and Random Forests]: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict diabetes.
