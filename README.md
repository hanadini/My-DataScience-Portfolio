# My-DataScience-Portfolio
DSc. Studies and minor/major Projects 
This repository includes portfolio of data science projects completed by me for researching, self learning. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.


_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning in Python 
		(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20in%20Python)

	- [CLV(Customer Lifetime Value) & Churn prediction]: In this project it was working For an online retail, can select North Star Metric as Monthly Revenue.
	- [Detect Credit Card Fraud]: For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, It was made use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.
	- [Time Series Forecast with Python: Monthly Sales of French Champagne]: predict the number of monthly sales of champagne for a region in France.The dataset provides the number of monthly sales of champagne just under 10 years of data.
	
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 

- ### Deep Learning Projects: 
		(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/DL(Rnn%2CCnn%2CMlp%2CTF))

	- [Computer Vision]: Evaluate Pixel Scaling Methods for Image Classification With CNNs,with MNIST Handwritten Image Classification Dataset. Using Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification,training the model and image augmentation via the ImageDataGenerator class.
	
	- [Natural Languagee processing]:Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project.

	- [TensorFlow(tf.keras)] Develope MLP, CNN,RNN models with tensorflow.Visualize, plot, save and load models and getting better performance from the model in tf.

	- [LSTM RNN:Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network]: Text generation to learn the dependencies between characters and the conditional probabilities of characters in sequences so that we can in turn generate wholly new and original sequences of characters of a favorite book from childhood as the dataset.
	
	- [LSTM RNN]: to predict the number of international airline passengers in units of 1,000.
