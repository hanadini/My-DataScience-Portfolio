# My-DataScience-Portfolio
DSc. Studies and minor/major Projects 
This repository includes portfolio of data science projects completed by me for researching, self learning. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.


_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning in Python 
	(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20in%20Python)

	- [CLV(Customer Lifetime Value) & Churn prediction]: In this project it was working For an online retail, can select North Star Metric as Monthly Revenue.
	
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 

- ### Deep Learning Projects: 
	(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio/tree/master/DL(Rnn%2CCnn%2CMlp%2CTF))
	- [Recommendation System]: I used datasets hosted by Kaggle and considering the content-based approach, for building job recommendation systems.

	- [Computer Vision]: Evaluate Pixel Scaling Methods for Image Classification With CNNs,with MNIST Handwritten Image Classification Dataset. Using Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification,training the model and image augmentation via the ImageDataGenerator class.
	
	- [Natural Languagee processing]:Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project.
	- [BERT for classification]: the dataset from Kaggle is text from consumer finance complaint narrative, the model attempts to predict which product the complaint is about. So is a multi-class classification problem.

	- [TensorFlow(tf.keras)] Develope MLP, CNN,RNN models with tensorflow.Visualize, plot, save and load models and getting better performance from the model in tf.

	- [LSTM RNN:Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network]: Text generation to learn the dependencies between characters and the conditional probabilities of characters in sequences so that we can in turn generate wholly new and original sequences of characters of a favorite book from childhood as the dataset.
	 
	
- ### Micro Projects: 
	- __R__ 
		(https://github.com/hanadini/My-DataScience-Portfolio)
		- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems]: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
		- [ML Decision Trees and Random Forests]: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict diabetes.
